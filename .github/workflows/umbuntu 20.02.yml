# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

# 💁 The OpenShift Starter workflow will:
# - Checkout your repository
# - Perform a container image build
# - Push the built image to the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
# - Log in to your OpenShift cluster
# - Create an OpenShift app from the image and expose it to the internet

# ℹ️ Configure your repository and the workflow with the following steps:
# 1. Have access to an OpenShift cluster. Refer to https://www.openshift.com/try
# 2. Create the OPENSHIFT_SERVER and OPENSHIFT_TOKEN repository secrets. Refer to:            - name: OpenShift Self Hosted Runner Installer
  # You may pin to the exact commit or the version.

    # GitHub Personal access token. The token must have the "repo" permission scope.
For organization runners, the token must also have the "admin:org" scope.

    github_pat: 
    # Repository or organization for the self-hosted runner.
For example, "redhat-actions/check-self-hosted-runner" for a repository, or "redhat-actions" for an organization.
Defaults to the current repository.

    runner_location: # optional
    # Container image to use for the runner.
    runner_image: # optional
    # Tag to use for the runner container image.
    runner_tag: # optional
    # Labels in the runners to check for.
For multiple labels, separate by comma and an optional space. For example, "label1, label2".

    runner_labels: # optional
    # Number of runner replicas to create.
    runner_replicas: # optional, default is 1
    # Optional namespace (aka project) to pass to all Helm or Kubernetes commands.

    namespace: # optional
    # Uninstall any release that matches the `helm_release_name` and `namespace` before running `helm install`.
If this is false, and the release exists, the action will fail when the `helm install` fails.

    helm_uninstall_existing: # optional, default is true
    # The Helm Release name to give the new runner release. Defaults to the repository or org name plus "-runners".
    helm_release_name: # optional
    # Any other arguments to pass to the 'helm install' command.
Separate arguments by newline. Do not use quotes - @actions/exec will do the quoting for you.

    helm_extra_args: # optional
    # Version of our Helm Chart to install. Defaults to the latest.
    helm_chart_version: # optional

# 3. (Optional) Edit the top-level 'env' section as marked with '🖊️' if the defaults are not suitable for your project.
# 4. (Optional) Edit the build-image step to build your project.
#    The default build type is by using a Dockerfile at the root of the repository,
#    but can be replaced with a different file, a source-to-image build, or a step-by-step buildah build.
# 5. Commit and push the workflow file to your default branch to trigger a workflow run.
